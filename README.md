## 🏢 Designed & Engineered by Danger Labs

**Stock Market Ka Don (SMKD)** was architected and built by **Danger Labs**, an elite engineering research and quantitative trading systems lab. Danger Labs designs mission-critical algorithmic software, high-frequency signal pipelines, and low-latency reactive frontends.

> *"Precision over hype. Mathematical expectancy over speculation."* — **Danger Labs Core Philosophy**

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

**SMKD** solves the core challenges faced by active retail and prop traders in Indian markets: execution lag, cognitive overload, emotional whipsaws, and scam-ridden signal services that ignore market friction and repainting. 

By unifying **closed-candle mathematical indicators**, **live Indian financial news sentiment NLP**, **automated risk-to-reward boundary calculations**, and a **custom zero-VDOM fine-grained reactive terminal (Zuari Framework)**, SMKD delivers institutional-grade trade setups directly linked to broker execution cards (Groww MIS/CNC).

---

## 🌟 Key Features

| Capability | Specification | Architectural Highlight |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Intraday Engine (MIS)** | 5-Minute Timeframe Multi-Indicator Confluence | VWAP + 9/21 Dual EMA + 14-period RSI + ATR Dynamic Volatility Bands |
| **Delivery Engine (CNC)** | Daily / Multi-Week Positional Swing Scanner | Golden/Death Crossover (20/50 EMA), Volume Accumulation & Stage-2 Breakouts |
| **News Catalyst NLP** | Live Real-time Sentiment Scraper | RSS pipeline parsing Indian business feeds (Moneycontrol, Mint, ET) with tone scoring |
| **Zero-VDOM UI Terminal** | Built on Danger Labs' `@zuari` signals system | Sub-millisecond reactive DOM mutations without the overhead of heavy Virtual-DOM engines |
| **Trap Avoidance Engine** | Strict IST Market Session Filter | Flags 9:15–9:45 AM opening traps and blocks low-liquidity noon chop zones |
| **One-Click Broker Deep Links**| Instant Contextual Execution Linkage | Directly opens pre-configured symbol order cards on Groww Web/Mobile |

## 📊 Trading Engine & Strategy Matrix

### 1. Intraday Momentum Strategy (`Groww MIS`)
* **Timeframe**: 5-Minute closed candles (Strict anti-repainting policy).
* **Confluence Rules**:
  * **Long Entry**: Price > VWAP, 9-EMA > 21-EMA, RSI between 55 and 70 (Momentum acceleration without exhaustion).
  * **Short Entry**: Price < VWAP, 9-EMA < 21-EMA, RSI between 30 and 45.
* **Risk Parameters**:
  * Automated stop-loss pegged to recent swing extremes or $1.5 \times \text{ATR}$.
  * Mandatory minimum Target:Risk ratio of **1:2** to guarantee positive expectancy.

### 2. Positional Swing Strategy (`Groww CNC`)
* **Timeframe**: Daily candle confirmation.
* **Confluence Rules**:
  * 20-Day EMA above 50-Day EMA (Golden Trend Confirmation).
  * Volume expansion > $1.5 \times$ 20-day average volume during breakout sessions.
* **Holding Horizon**: 3 to 15 trading days.

### 3. Anti-Scam & Risk Management Guardrails
* **No Unrealistic Claims**: High-frequency quant funds run between **55% to 65% win rates**. Anyone claiming 90%+ is selling curve-fitted or repainting algorithms.
* **Friction Awareness**: Filters out all micro-moves $< 0.7\%$ to guarantee trades remain profitable after STT, GST (18%), exchange turnover fees, SEBI charges, and broker commission.
* **Liquid Universe Only**: Scans only **F&O eligible constituent stocks** (Nifty 100) to protect capital against illiquid 5% circuit freezes and auction penalties.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Known Constraints

Active issues, architectural constraints, and enhancement roadmaps are tracked transparently in the **[GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/dr-week/STOCK-MARKET-KA-DON/issues)**:

1. **Third-Party Rate Limits**: Upstream Yahoo Finance / unofficial tick providers may enforce intermittent rate limits during high market volatility. Integration of official broker WebSocket APIs (Zerodha Kite Connect / Groww API) is planned.
2. **Delayed Indian Feed on Free Endpoints**: Free upstream data tiers may experience a 1–2 minute delay. Production deployments should attach a paid low-latency market data feed.
3. **Automated Order Placement Requires Broker Credentials**: Currently provides verified direct deep-links to Groww order tickets; automated non-supervised trade execution requires active TOTP broker authorization.
4. **Execution Slippage**: Rapid gap openings between 9:15 AM and 9:20 AM may cause execution price variance from calculated entry prices.
